        <div id="expertise">
            <h3>My Story and Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>My firsts experiences were related to <span class="special-text">Web & Mobile Development</span>. In the case of my Thesis Project I was kind of a Junior Full-Stack, I developed a Real-Time Platform dedicated at first to receive data packages from an unknow number of sensors, then filter and process that data for, finally, send it to the available clients (WebApp and MobileApp), in order to display to the user. This platform goal was the tracking of the public transport service and I learn a lot about Load Balancing, High Performance and protocols like TCP, UDP and WebSockets in and applied way, for the web app I use the HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack and the JQuery library, and for the mobile app I developed Java code for Android Devices.</p>
            <p>The <span class="special-text">Machine Learning</span> area is quite new for me, but I've found simply amazing the way we can teach a machine to do tasks in a similar way than a person, specially those tasks that are defficult o even impossible for us. So, I'm getting deep into this area.</p>
            <p>Finally, it's incredible the amount of data available on the net, and even more the things we can learn or discover for different purposes, like social solutions. That's the reason of my interest on <span class="special-text">Data Analysis</span>. The complement of this is the way we can show information to the society in general, in my opinion is very important to complement our studies with <span class="special-text">Data Visualization</span> skills in order to achieve everyone's understanding and, maybe, empower participation.</p>

            <h3>Areas of interest</h3>
            <p>Since I got started in Computer Sciences, I've had big passion for the <span class="special-text">Software Engineering</span> area. We can find there that programming is a good skill, but is not enough to give solution to a complex problem, to build a platform or to work in a team. We need to learn that planning a project and making up the design is the most important part.</p>

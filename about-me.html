            <h2> A little more about me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently 27 y.o. and I'm from Veracruz, México. I studied <span class="special-text">Computer
                Systems Engineering</span> at the Instituto Tecnológico de Veracruz (<a href="#">ITVer</a>) with an
                specialization in "Mobile and Web Development Technologies", so my background is oriented to
                programming, database management and computer networks.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <p class="footer">Day of my graduation at the ITVer.</p>
                <img class="text-related" src="imgs/timeline/itver.jpg"/>

            </div>

            <p>At the end of my bachelor studies, I moved to Guanajuato City for working on my thesis project at the
                Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (<a href="https://www.cimat.mx/">CIMAT</a>), advised by PhD.
                Rogelio Hasimoto Beltrán and PhD. Rafael Rivera López. Honestly, this was one of the best experiences of
                my life, personally and professionally, because I met amazing people and I learned so much from them.</p>
            <p>My Thesis project was about a platform for tracking the public transport system in real-time, a flexible
                model that could work for every mexican city and would lead the citizen to use the bus instead a private
                car. For this, I had to go deeper in stuff like high performance software design and load balancing,
                patterns, web services, network protocols, data transmission and others. I took some programming classes
                and I was the <span class="special-text">teaching assistant</span> of the "Advanced Programming Topics"
                class, focused on networks programming, protocols and data transmission with C programming language. In
                general, it was a very enriching stage, I <b>really</b> recommend this place.</p>

            </div>


            <p>During my stay at CIMAT, I got the chance to work remotely for the Centro Nacional de Supercómputo
                (<a href="http://www.cns-ipicyt.mx/">CNS</a>) as a junior software developer, advised by PhD. Salvador
                Ruiz Correa, but in 2017 I moved to San Luis City for working in situ. At this time I was working on a
                mobile crowdsourcing platform based on a Services Oriented Architecture.</p>

            <p>Late in 2017, I was promoted as the lead web software engineer of the Youth Innovation Laboratory
                (<a href="http://youilab.ipicyt.edu.mx/You-i.Lab/">You-i Lab</a>), an
                <span class="special-text">interdisciplinary group</span> focused on tech-projects for social good. This
                is my current job, such a pleasure to collaborate with this awesome team. Here, I have worked on social
                problems like pollution, air quality, water conservation and public politics based on the citizens
                opinions and necessities, applying things like data analytics, social engineering and GIS, besides
                software development of course.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Since 2019, I've been working as an <span class="special-text">independent consultant</span> too,
                collaborating with other for other companies and organizations like the Instituto Nacional de
                Antropología e Historia (INAH).</p>

            <h2> Finally... My hobbies</h2>
            <p>I'm not a robot!</p>
            <p>Some of my activities are focused on keeping me healthy and to relax my mind and soul. I love <span class="special-text">volunteering</span> for social causes, I truly believe this kind of services help us for being in touch with real life and real necessities, and those are a good way for not loosing our "humanity", I can really say. I really enjoy <span class="special-text">working out</span> because, principaly, it helps me to release stress while staying in shape. And last, but not least, I can share that I'm in love with music, I <span class="special-text">sing</span> in a chorus in the role of Tenor, which is AWESOME!.</p>

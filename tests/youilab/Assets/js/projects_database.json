The studies will look at how the platform can improve students’ quality of life inside and outside the academic environment. \nWeNet’s innovative paradigm impacts human interactions in general, especially those that may benefit from a collaborative approach (creative industries, medical diagnosis, …). The WeNet consortium will develop a research infrastructure to exploit the project results and strengthen the European innovation ecosystem with a worldwide perspective.",

The proposal addresses research questions in four areas: (1) general questions, (2) knowledge, (3) skills and (4) practices, all related to the patterns of use of ICT, with emphasis on the use of mobile media and social networks.

In particular, shared accommodation services through which peers can post, find, and book accommodation made available by others, are used by people worldwide. Despite this success, relatively little academic work has done to understand practices and perceptions of peer accommodation. Our project aims to understand how peer accommodation services are perceived and used in developed and developing countries. We consider Switzerland and Mexico as case studies. Putting emphasis on both psychological and computational aspects, the project spans field work, lab experiments, crowdsourcing, and data mining to study peer accommodation in the two target countries. Airbnb sites in México are shown in the heat map on the left. The project is supported by the EPFL-UNIL Program on Cross-Disciplinary Research on Science and Society (CROSS).
